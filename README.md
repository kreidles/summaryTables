The summaryTables Package
=========================

This package contains functions for building summary tables which appear frequently in
biomedical manuscripts.  For example, the function "summaryTable" produces a Table 1
which is typically used to summarize patient demographics, etc.  This package is still
a *work in progress*. 

The package can be installed as follows:

* Install R version 3.0.x or higher by following the instructions at http://www.r-project.org
* From the R environment, install and load the "devtools" package
```R
> install.packages("devtools")
> library(devtools)
```
* Install the "summaryTables" package directly from Github.com
```R
> install_github(repo="summaryTables", user="kreidles", ref="develop")
```
* Load the library
```R
> library(summaryTables)
```
